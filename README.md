# OpenCV Python Installation
```
pip3 install opencv-python
```
Then open a python file, type `import cv2`, and run it. If this runs with no complaints, you are (for now) all set!
   
## FAQ/Debugging
 - If you are having `ImportError` issues and are on Mac OSX El Capitan, the latest OpenCV build might not work properly. The fix is to install an earlier version of OpenCV:
 ```
 pip3 install opencv-python==3.4.2.16
 ```
